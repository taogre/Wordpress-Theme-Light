#### What don't to do

To get the best out of this theme don't do:

* Don't use a feautured image --> the list won't look without feautured images
* Use submenus --> this theme has no code for submenus: **it will just look bad**
* Don't use a author image
* Don't write a author description
* This theme is not ment for multiple users
